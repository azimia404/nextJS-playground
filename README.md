# Next.js Invoice management project

This is the project to show my skills in Next.js. A website for managing payments and invoices with creating, editing, deleting using server database, pagination, sorting, optimization, caching, and many other possibilities!

## Streaming components!

With Next.js it is easy to stream components so they do not stuck the website and the user is able to continue enjoying everything without waiting for every component!

The Webapp uses React components and Suspense to show skeleton of the fetching data even if it is not on hands. It is also optimized by Next.js `Image` elements and `Fonts`. Caching is included too!

## Database!

The Webapp has fully working relational SQL database. You can create, edit, and delete invoices without any doubts about security, thanks to Next.js embedded hashing.

Next.js `Suspense` prevents "waterfall", when the webapp is fetching data in a sequance. `Promise.all()` lets parallel fetching and `Suspense` ensures that nothing will break if some data is delivered earlier than other.

## Sorting & Searching!

With Next.js making sorting and searching is ever easy! All the data fetches do not stagger every tap but wait for user to end its search to not overload the server. It lowers the fetching and makes life easier to manage big users base with limited recources.

## Optimization!

Creating the invoices is secured and easy. With Next.js optimization and Server Side Rendering, SEO of the webapp has become even better. You do not have to worry about caching providing deprecated information because `revalidatePath` is used in the project.

Overall, it was a great journey of working with Next.js!
